# GCN for Node Classification on the Cora Dataset

This project is a simple implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to perform node classification on the Cora citation network dataset. The model learns to predict the academic topic of a paper based on its content and its citation links to other papers.

This code uses the [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

## Project Goal

The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs. By using both the node features (a paper's bag-of-words) and the graph structure (its citations), the GCN can achieve significantly higher accuracy than a model that only looks at the paper's content alone.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset: Cora

* **Nodes:** 2,708 scientific publications.
* **Edges:** 5,429 citation links between papers.
* **Node Features:** A 1,433-dimension binary vector for each paper, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific words from a dictionary.
* **Labels:** Each paper is categorized into one of 7 topics (e.g., "Neural Networks", "Theory").

## ðŸ§  Model: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

The model is a simple 2-layer GCN:
1.  **Layer 1:** A `GCNConv` layer that takes the 1,433 node features and aggregates neighborhood information to create 16-dimensional "hidden" embeddings for each node. This is followed by a `ReLU` activation.
2.  **Layer 2:** A final `GCNConv` layer that takes the 16-dimensional embeddings and aggregates neighborhood information one more time to produce the final 7-dimensional logit scores for each of the 7 classes.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Karl-0-1/gcn-cora.git](https://github.com/Karl-0-1/gcn-cora.git)
    cd gcn-cora-project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: PyTorch and PyG installation can sometimes be complex. If the above fails, please follow the official installation guides for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html).*

4.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python train_gcn.py
    ```

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

You should see the model train for 200 epochs. The output will show the training loss and validation/test accuracy every 10 epochs.
